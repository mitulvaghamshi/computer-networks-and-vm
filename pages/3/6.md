# Oracle VM VirtualBox Shared Folders

## Creating a Shared Folder

- On a running Guest OS, right-click on the folder icon located at the bottom of
  it's console window (one below battery and network icon)
- Then, click on "Shared Folders Settings..."

- Click on the add new shared folder icon

- Click on the (Folder Path) arrow, and select which folder on your Host OS will
  be "shared" to this Guest OS
- Oracle VirtualBox shared folders are only available to the Guest OS for which
  you are configuring them on
- If you have multiple Guest OSes running, you would need to perform a similar
  process for each of them (if required)

- Here, I wish to share the "Windows" folder currently located on my portable
  USB-powered storage device which is attached to my Host OS
- Once completely configured, I will be able to access folders and files below
  this "Windows" folder from within this Guest OS
- Using the Oracle VirtualBox Shared Folders feature is a great way of
  transferring files between a Guest OS and the Host OS

- By default, the share name (a.k.a. Folder Name) will inherit the (Folder
  Path's) folder name
- Most of the time, this is not ideal

- Type in a share name value that is relatively short, and contains no `<space>`
  characters, symbol characters, etc
- The value should be unique to this Guest OS, and something that you can easily
  remember

- Once the shared folder has been created for the Guest OS, click on the (OK)
  button to complete the process

## Mapping to a Shared Folder

- From within the Guest OS you created an Oracle VirtualBox shared folder for,
  map a network drive to it

![](../../images/3/6.img-8.webp)

- The UNC value includes a hard-coded (`nodename`)
- The (`sharename`) portion of the UNC value is whatever value you chose earlier
- Enter a UNC format of either:
  - `\\vboxsrv\sharename` -or-
  - `\\vboxsvr\sharename`

![](../../images/3/6.img-9.webp)

- You now have a network drive mapping out to a folder located on the Host OS
- Folders and files can now be copied from the Guest OS out to the Host OS, or
  into the Guest OS
- The copy process (either way) is performed solely from within the Guest OS

## Removing a Mapped Network Drive

- If access to the Oracle VirtualBox shared folder is no longer required,
  disconnect the drive mapping

## Removing a Shared Folder

- Once the shared folder is no longer being used by the Guest OS, it can safely
  be removed
- Return to the Oracle VirtualBox Shared Folder icon
- Select the shared folder you wish to remove, and click on the remove icon

![](../../images/3/6.img-12.webp)

- The Oracle VirtualBox shared folder has been successfully removed

![](../../images/3/6.img-13.webp)

- All problems occurring with the Oracle VirtualBox Shared Folders feature, are
  caused by users not paying attention to the share name they create
- Leaving `<space>` characters, or symbol characters, in the share name will
  cause problems
- Likewise, not remembering the share name value for the shared folder will also
  cause problems when you go to map a network drive to it
